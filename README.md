# SimpleCodeTestTask

Write an efficient algorithm (in C#): 
class Solution { public static int[] solution(string[] A, string[] B); }    
that, given a non-empty array A of N hosts, and B of M forbidden hosts, returns a sequence 
consisting of L integers where each integer represents an index of a host in input A array that can 
be visited by user.

Assume that:  
• N and M are integers within the range [1..100000];  
• L is integer within the range [0..100000];  
• each element of array A is a string with length [2.. 256];  
• each element of collection B is a string with length [2..256].


Complexity:   
• expected worst-case time complexity is O(N + M)
